SymmetryPlane
==========================================
Copyright 2021 Cadence Design Systems, Inc. All rights reserved worldwide.

This Glyph script projects connectors and domains onto a user specified
symmetry plane. Its intended use is to correct the lack of precision
often found in the symmetry plane geometry in a CAD file that is
inherited by the grid. A Tk interface is provided for specifying the
symmetry plane, a tolerance (only points within that tolerance will be
projected onto the symmetry plane), and controls for whether connectors
are always projected or only if necessary and whether the script will
project just connectors or domains also.
